# folpsD


This is a temporary repository for the folpsD version of the code folps. It will be migrated to the official folps repositories https://github.com/cosmodesi/folpsax and https://github.com/henoriega/FOLPS-nu once it is finished

folpsD includes damping factors, expected from non perturbative effects. It can reach wavenumbers larger than k>0.3 h/Mpc

folpsD also includes the Sugiyama Bispectrum https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02132


Significant modifications on Nov 23, 2025. A couple of bugs solved. + now it computes more multipoles: B000, B110, B220, B202, B112, B404.
