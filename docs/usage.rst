Usage and examples
==================

The detailed runnable examples are available in the `Examples` and `Quickstart` pages. For a short, runnable script use `examples/run_simple.py` (see the Examples section in the docs).

If you want to run the longer notebook examples, open `run_folps_numpy.ipynb` or `run_folps_jax.ipynb` in Jupyter or Colab.
